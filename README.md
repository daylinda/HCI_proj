## 📖 Overview  

This repository contains a **mid-fidelity prototype website** developed as part of an HCI project.  
It demonstrates how users can **navigate learning paths** across multiple languages, explore learning levels, and interact with structured educational pages.

## 🧩 What is Mid-Fidelity?  

In **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and UX design**, prototypes are often created at different levels of **fidelity**:  

- **Low-fidelity** → Rough sketches/wireframes, showing layout but little detail.  
- **Mid-fidelity** → Interactive layouts with **navigation flow and structured content**, but without full styling or backend functionality.  
- **High-fidelity** → Fully functional, polished prototypes resembling the **final product**.  

👉 This project is **mid-fidelity**, meaning it focuses on:  
- **Page structure** (how content is arranged)  
- **Navigation flow** (moving between English, Hindi, and Spanish learning paths)  
- **Basic interactions** (prototype-ready, not production-ready)  

It does **not yet include** responsive design, accessibility improvements, or final UI styling.
